Installation
------------

Install the latest version with

```bash
$ composer require git-pull-request/git
```

Requirements
------------

At the time this project was created, PHP 7 was the latest stable version. So it became the de facto PHP supported
version.

We try to have as fewer dependencies as possible.  
If you can not use this project because of its library dependencies, please open an issue.
